# Top-Deck: MTG - An Exploration of Patterns in Magic: The Gathering Cards
Hello readers! This, is Top-Deck: MTG, an in-depth exploration of card patterns and trends in Magic: The Gathering—my favorite card game.
In this project, I’m diving into the dataset of MTG cards to analyze card types, colors, artists, and subtypes to uncover potential correlations within the MTG universe.

Project Overview:
The main goal of Top-Deck is to investigate patterns within different MTG cards
I'm specifically looking to see if certain characteristics are associated with specific outcomes. For example:

Q1: Is there a relationship between a card’s type and its color? (e.g., do green cards predominantly feature elves, while red cards feature goblins?)
Q2: Do certain artists appear more frequently on popular cards?
Q3: Are there hidden correlations in card subtypes or color identities?

By exploring these questions, this project aims to provide insights that could enhance both gameplay strategy and our understanding of MTG’s card design structure.

In Top-Deck we employ a variety of data science skills and techniques, including:

-Data Wrangling & Cleaning: Organizing and preparing card data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovering patterns within the data by applying group-by operations and visualizations.

-Data Visualization: Using tools like Plotly and Matplotlib to create visual representations of the dataset’s insights.

-Statistical Analysis: Identifying and interpreting statistical relationships to find hidden correlations in card features.


Project Status
Top-Deck is a work in progress due to the complexity of the dataset and the intricate relationships within MTG’s card characteristics. The project continues to evolve, with further analyses and insights planned to deepen the understanding of patterns in MTG.

Roadmap
Complete initial EDA on color distributions, artists, types, and subtypes.
Perform advanced statistical analysis to verify any correlations.
Develop visualizations to summarize findings.
Explore machine learning techniques for predictive modeling (if feasible).
Publish results and insights for the MTG community.


Thank you for checking out Top-Deck: MTG! This project is fueled by a love for Magic: The Gathering and a curiosity for data-driven insights. I look forward to sharing new discoveries as the project progresses!
